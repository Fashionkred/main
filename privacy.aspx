                    any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Site.&nbsp; You are

                    in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings

                    As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site,
                    services, features and content, to administer your Membership (together, the “Service”)
                    and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site. &nbsp;</p>

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    o When you register with us through the Site, as a FashionKred Subscriber or when you
                    choose to create your own profile webpage we will ask you for personally identifiable
                    information.&nbsp; This refers to information about you that can be used to contact
                    or identify you (“Personal Information”).&nbsp; Personal Information includes, but
                    is not limited to, your name, username, phone number, credit card or other billing
                    information, email address and home and business postal addresses, and any other
                    information that you decide to add to your profile webpage.&nbsp; We use your Personal
                    Information mainly to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0px;">

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    o We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration
                    and the administration and personalization of the My Account webpage (e.g., without
                    limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences) (“Non-Identifying

                    o We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying
                    Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer
                    your inquiries.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                <p style="margin: 0px;">

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    o We may also collect information regarding your activity on the Site, such as your
                    bidding history, auctions participated in, auctions won/lost, prices paid, bids
                    used and other similar information associated with your username. We use such information
                    solely in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    o Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal
                    Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your
                    zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified.&nbsp;
                    But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when
                    they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for
                    example, your viewing preferences).&nbsp; We may combine your Personal Information
                    with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from
                    other FashionKred Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience,
                    to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how
                    our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without
                    aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you
                    according to your preferences or restrictions.</p>

                    We also use your Personal Information to contact you with FashionKred newsletters,
                    marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest
                    to you.&nbsp; If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
                    communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any
                    of the communications or update your “email preferences” information in your

                    non-registered user just browsing (any of these, a “FashionKred User”), our servers
                    automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website
                    (“Log Data”).&nbsp; This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s
                    Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting
                    before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on
                    those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and
                    other statistics.&nbsp; We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the
                    Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our
                    Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’
                    needs.&nbsp; For example, some of this information is collected so that when you
                    visit the Site again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information
                    appropriate to your interests.&nbsp; We also use this information to verify that
                    visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.&nbsp;
                    [We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with
                    other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information
                    for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.]</p>

                    Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.&nbsp; A cookie is a
                    small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping
                    purposes.&nbsp; We use cookies for two purposes.&nbsp; First, we utilize persistent
                    cookies to save your registration ID for future logins to the Site.&nbsp; Second,
                    we utilize persistent ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better
                    understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by FashionKred
                    Users and web traffic routing on the Site. Third party advertisers on the Site may
                    also place or read cookies on your browser.&nbsp; You can instruct your browser,
                    by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting
                    a cookie from the websites you visit.&nbsp; If you do not accept cookies, however,

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    As part of the Service, FashionKred Subscribers may choose to communicate with FashionKred
                    Subscribers and non-registered users through use of their accounts.&nbsp; Where
                    FashionKred Subscribers have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses
                    to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be
                    sent from FashionKred to those email addresses on their behalf.&nbsp; These email addresses
                    will be stored in the address book the FashionKred Subscriber creates and will be used
                    only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. &nbsp;</p>

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    As part of the Service, we may allow FashionKred Subscribers to invite friends to participate
                    in FashionKred service. When FashionKred Subscribers have selected the option of adding
                    one or more email addresses to an online form or via an address book import, the
                    resulting invites will be sent to those email addresses on their behalf.&nbsp; These
                    email addresses will be stored in the import friends function that FashionKred creates
                    and will be used only for the purpose of sending the email invite to the addressee(s)
                    selected by the FashionKred Subscribers.&nbsp;</p>

                <p style="margin: 0px;">
                    Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern
                    to FashionKred.&nbsp; Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft
                    is a top priority.&nbsp; We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit
                    card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers
                    in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication.&nbsp; For more

                    your Personal Information to create a profile webpage, FashionKred Users will see your
                    “Screen Name” and the month and year you first registered with FashionKred (“Required
                    Subscriber Identifiers”). You can choose what other Personal Information you provide
                    as part of your profile (“Other Subscriber Information”) and in some cases you can
                    choose whether to share that information publicly on the Site by making selections
                    via the “user preferences” section of your profile webpage.&nbsp; Providing Other
                    Subscriber Information is voluntary and should correlate with the degree of interaction
                    you want to have with FashionKred Users. We recommend that you guard your anonymity
                    and sensitive information and that you not use your real name as your “Screen Name,”
